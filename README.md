# Heart-Disease-classification---SVM-Classification
This project will focus on predicting heart disease using Support Vector Machine classifier. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.We will use this data to create a model which tries predict if a patient has heart disease or not.
